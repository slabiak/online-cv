      tagline: "Web application which lists rooms/flats to rent with each one having calculated time of travel
        (by car, foot, bike or public transportation) to place selected by user (for example their work or school). This is my first full-stack project where I developed backend (Java &
Spring) and frontend (React). This application is completely independent of external APIs like
Google Maps. All routing, geocoding, reversed geocoding and autocomplete for place search
is done with the use of open source solutions (GrapHopper, OpenStreetPlanner, Photon and
OpenStreetMap). More details on projectâ€™s site. This project is still under heavy development."
